# IoT Based Online Monitoring System for Leakage Detection in Water Supply Pipelines
"Online monitoring of water supply pipe lines to identify water leakage.
Water supply pipeline from MK Dam to the RDC plant is approx. 25 Kms long. Real-time monitoring of leakages is done through only 2 flow meters located at both ends of the pipelines. This leads to delayed response times due to the time taken to identify the leakage points. A comprehensive solution is needed to identify and locate leakages in real-time."
